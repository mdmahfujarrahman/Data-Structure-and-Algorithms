## Big O Notation

Big O Notation is a way to formalize fuzzy counting-(Shorthand counting how much operation has happing on a function)

        Big O Notation is simply Counting how much operation has happing on a function

#### Why we need to know Big O Notation?

Imagine we have multiple implementations of the same function. How can we determine which one is best. There's come Big O notation. We can chose which function take less time and less space.

If we see a function we can describe this function in this word

#### Who cares Big O Notation?

:point_right: How our code performs , it's important to we have right vocabulary to talk.
